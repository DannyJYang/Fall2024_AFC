## Welcome to Monster Killer

This is a monster hunter database project that I created to kill large monsters quickly.
I wanted to know what certain large monsters are weak to element and ailment wise and what sort of elements or ailments
monsters do to hunters, and what parts are breakable/severable.


            
## Limitations
Currently limited to only large monsters in Monster hunter World

## API that I am using
Currently utilizing MH: World DB (https://contrib.mhw-db.com/)

## Potential Future Updates
Will have to make my own database and assets for MH World: Iceborne, MH Rise and MH Wilds

## Things to do
- Change font to a custom font
- Implement favorites function
- Move background music audio slider to somewhere better
- Monster Hunter menu sound effect when mouse hovers or clicks something
- custom mouse cursor?
- Maybe use monster hunter world theme as another background music
- Click monster icon in search and it plays monster roar sound
