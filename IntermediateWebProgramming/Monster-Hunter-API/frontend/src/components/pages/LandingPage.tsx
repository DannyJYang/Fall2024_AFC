            <h1>Welcome to Monster Killer</h1>

            <p>This is a monster hunter database project that I created to kill large monsters quickly.</p>
            <p>I wanted to know what certain large monsters are weak to element and ailment wise, what sort of elements or ailments</p>
            <p>monsters do to hunters, and what parts are breakable/severable. </p>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>Currently limited to only large monsters in Monster hunter World</p>

            <h3>API that I am using</h3>
            <p>Currently utilizing MH: World DB (https://contrib.mhw-db.com/)</p>

            <h3>Potential Future Updates</h3>
            <p>Will have to make my own database and assets for MH World: Iceborne, MH Rise and MH Wilds</p>

            <h2>Things to do</h2>
            <p><s>Change font to a custom font</s></p>
            <p><s>Implement favorites function</s></p>
            <p><s>Move background music audio slider to somewhere better</s></p>
            <p>Monster Hunter menu sound effect when mouse hovers or clicks something</p>
            <p>Custom mouse cursor?</p>
            <p><s>Maybe use monster hunter world theme as another background music</s></p>
            <p>Click monster icon in search and it plays monster roar sound</p>
            <p>Use markdown file for the landing page</p>
